            <p>
                More than a century has passed since Mrs. William Rand gathered a small
                group of ladies together at her home on Forest Avenue for the first meeting
                of the Rye Garden Club. It is fitting that one of the first programs on record offered
                by Rye Garden Club was on the topic of the interrelationship of insects and
                plant life. One hundred years later, we installed a pollinator garden at Edith
                G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary as our Centennial Gift to the community and this
                educational mission continues.

                From the beginning, Rye Garden Club has endeavored to promote the love of
                gardening, floral design and the natural world among its members and the
                community and to contribute to the well-being of Rye. A stroll though Rye
                Garden Club archives chronicles steady and true dedication to these missions.
                In 1918 the club hosted a bulb show for the public, led workshops on war
                gardens and canning vegetables and raised funds for the Red Cross and United
                Hospital. Educational programs at Rye elementary schools began in the 1940s
                and continue with strength today. Tree and garden plantings for the city have
                been a consistent part of every year's works.

            <p>
                Our club's relationship with the
                Rye Free Reading Room began in 1948 when the club took over pruning tasks there.
                In the 1960s and 80s the club designed and planted gardens at the library and
                Square House that we continue to improve and maintain today. For United Hospital
                the club provided weekly flower arrangements beginning in 1947 and later installed
                a meditation garden for patients. Over 20 years of May Market fundraisers, plant
                sales at the home of Jean Flagler Matthews, provided the funds for the many
                organizations Rye Garden Club has supported over the years.

                Along with these industrious civic works, Rye Garden Club members have participated
                in flower shows and championed conservation efforts. Wouldn't it be wonderful to
                see the "Garden of Tomorrow" that Rye Garden Club exhibited at the Worlds Fair in
                1939 or to hear Edith G. Read speak to defeat the Penther Dam Project and later the
                Oyster Bay Bridge? Awards received at flower shows around the country by esteemed
                Rye Garden Club members Kit Barker in floral design, and Betsy Jennings in
                horticulture, are almost too numerous to count.
