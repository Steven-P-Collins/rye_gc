        <p>
            More than a century has passed since Mrs. William Rand gathered a small
            group of ladies together at her home on Forest Avenue for the first meeting
            of the Rye Garden Club. The group dedicated itself to the â€˜advancement of
            gardening' and the protection of the natural resources of our beautiful
            coastal community. Over the years our club has stayed true to these
            commitments.
<!--            It is fitting that one of the first programs on record offered-->
<!--            by Rye Garden Club was on the topic of the interrelationship of insects and-->
<!--            plant life. One hundred years later, we install a pollinator garden at Edith-->
<!--            G. Read Wildlife Sanctuary as our Centennial Gift to the community and this-->
<!--            educational mission continues.-->
<!--            From the beginning, Rye Garden Club has endeavored to promote the love of-->
<!--            gardening, floral design and the natural world among its members and the-->
<!--            community and to contribute to the wellbeing of Rye. A stroll though Rye-->
<!--            Garden Club archives chronicles steady and true dedication to these missions.-->

        <div class="history"></div>
        <p>
            In 1918 the club hosted a bulb show for the public, led workshops on war
            gardens and canning vegetables and raised funds for the Red Cross and United
            Hospital. Educational programs at Rye elementary schools began in the 1940s
            and continue with strength today. Tree and garden plantings for the city have
            been a consistent part of every year's works. Our club's relationship with the
            Rye Free Reading Room began in 1948 when the club took over pruning tasks there.
            In the 1960s and 80s the club designed and planted gardens at the library and
            Square House that we continue to improve and maintain today. For United Hospital
            the club provided weekly flower arrangements beginning in 1947 and later installed
            a meditation garden for patients. Over 20 years of May Market fundraisers, plant
            sales at the home of Jean Flagler Matthews, provided the funds for the many
            organizations Rye Garden Club has supported over the years.

            Along with these industrious civic works, Rye Garden Club members have participated
            in flower shows and championed conservation efforts. Wouldn't it be wonderful to
            see the "Garden of Tomorrow" that Rye Garden Club exhibited at the Worlds Fair in
            1939 or to hear Edith G. Read speak to defeat the Penther Dam Project and later the
            Oyster Bay Bridge? Awards received at flower shows around the country by esteemed
            Rye Garden Club members Kit Barker in floral design, and Betsy Jennings in
            horticulture, are almost too numerous to count.

            We take pride in the history of our vibrant club and look ahead to an exciting future.
            Rye Garden Club is truly "One Hundred Years and Blooming."

        <p>
            Over the years The Rye Garden Club has been responsible for planting and maintaining a
            few gardens around Rye. Every spring and fall we clean up, trim back and put the
            gardens to bed at the Square House and the Rye Library. We also have planted and
            maintained the Knapp House island, which is located on Milton Road adjacent to the
            Knapp House. Along with these gardens, we also plant the pots along Purchase Street.
            We plant the pots seasonally, usually four times a year. For the holidays, we decorate
            the Rye Library, make wreaths for various town buildings and grow amaryllis bulbs that
            we deliver to civic organizations around town.

            The Rye Garden Club has offered and particiapted in numerous events over the course of
            its existence. Some of our finest moments have come from showcasing our work during the
            community garden walks, the She Flower Show, and our countless other events.
